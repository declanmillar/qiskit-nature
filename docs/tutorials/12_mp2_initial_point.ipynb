    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are going to describe how to use a Møller-Plesset-informed initial point for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with the ground state calculation interface of Qiskit Nature. The goal is to demonstrate that using such an initial point enables us to compute the ground state of an electronic molecular Hamiltonian using fewer evaluations than the default Hartree-Fock initial point. It will also serve to illustrate some changes to how initial points are \n",

    "Please see the tutorial on Ground State Solvers to learn the fundamentals of computing the molecular ground state with Qiskit Nature. To know more about the preparation of the Hamiltonian, check out the Electronic structure and Vibrational structure tutorials. \n",

    "As usual, the first step is to define the molecular system. In the following, we obtain the electronic part of a hydrogen molecule."

Since it is a chemistry standard, a factory is already available allowing a fast initialization of a VQE with UCC. The default is to use all single and double excitations. However, the excitation type (S, D, SD) as well as other parameters can be selected.\n",
    "2. An initial state: the initial state of the qubits. In the factory used above, the qubits are initialized in the Hartree-Fock (see the electronic structure tutorial) initial state (the qubits corresponding to occupied MOs are $|1\\rangle$ and those corresponding to virtual MOs are $|0\\rangle$.\n",
